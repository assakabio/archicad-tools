Why this project exists
Archicad Tools aims to streamline the day-to-day tasks inside ArchiCAD by offering a consistent set of utilities that reduce manual steps, lower the risk of errors, and improve collaboration. In many architecture firms, teams grapple with repetitive tasks like standard sheet setup, model checks, consistent labeling, and synchronized teamwork. This project concentrates those needs into a cohesive toolkit that fits existing workflows rather than forcing a new one.

Core concepts and architecture
- Modularity: The toolkit is built from independent modules that can be enabled or disabled per project. Modules can share data, but they do not tightly couple to one another, which makes upgrades safer and testing simpler.
- Extensibility: A plugin system allows teams to add custom scripts without touching the core. This keeps upgrades stable while enabling tailored workflows.
- Interoperability: The toolkit emphasizes open formats and clear interfaces, so data can move between ArchiCAD, IFC, BIMx, and rendering engines with predictable results.
- Automation-first mindset: Repetitive tasks are automated where practical. The CLI provides a predictable, scriptable surface that integrates with CI pipelines and build systems.
- Documentation-driven: Each module ships with its own documentation and sample templates to lower the barrier to adoption.

Features and benefits
- Modeling helpers: Quick setup for common building typologies, standardized layer structures, naming conventions, and parametric templates that apply across projects.
- Teamwork and collaboration: Tools to streamline sheet exchanges, model coordination, and status updates across distributed teams. Seamless state synchronization helps prevent conflicts.
- Rendering pipeline: A streamlined path from model to presentation. Predefined render settings, batch rendering, and automated export of image sequences for client reviews.
- Documentation automation: Auto-generated room data, schedules, material lists, and graphic standards documentation that align with project templates.
- Reproducible workflows: All steps can be reproduced in CI, so a project can be rebuilt with the same results any time, on any machine that has ArchiCAD installed.
- Cross-platform readiness: The toolkit supports Windows, macOS, and Linux workflows where applicable, with platform-specific installers and instructions.
- Accessibility and localization: Localized templates and descriptive labels that help teams work in different languages and meet accessibility considerations where needed.
- Observability: Built-in logging and diagnostic tools help teams track what the toolkit did, when, and why, making audits straightforward.

How to use Archicad Tools
Modeling helpers
- Template-driven modeling: The toolkit ships with standard templates for common project types such as residential, office, and education buildings. Each template predefines layers, pen sets, and naming schemes to ensure consistency across teams.
- Parametric presets: Modules include parametric controls for doors, windows, staircases, and furniture placements. By adjusting a few parameters, you can generate multiple design options rapidly without starting from scratch.
- Quick-start projects: The repository includes starter projects that illustrate best practices for structure, annotations, and labeling. Copy a starter and tailor it to your design brief.
- Quality gates: The modeling helpers include checks for model integrity, such as non-overlapping elements, correct room bounding, and valid material assignments. These checks run automatically during save or export.

Teamwork and collaboration
- Live coordination: The toolkit integrates with ArchiCAD Teamwork to help teams coordinate changes, track status, and resolve conflicts efficiently.
- Shared templates and standards: A central library stores standard templates, components, and libraries. Teams pull from this library to ensure consistency across projects.
- Versioned exports: When you export the model or deliverables, the toolkit can stamp the export with version information and a timestamp, which helps with audits and client reviews.
- Conflict resolution workflows: The system suggests resolution steps when conflicting edits occur, such as who should rework a layer or which model portion to prioritize.

Rendering and visualization
- Predefined rendering profiles: The toolkit provides a set of rendering profiles tuned for client presentations, internal reviews, and design development. These profiles balance quality, speed, and consistency.
- Batch rendering: You can queue multiple views for rendering, then batch process them overnight or during off-peak hours to maximize throughput.
- Output automation: The export process is integrated with naming conventions, file formats (PNG, JPEG, EXR), and resolution controls so you always get predictable results.
- Scene management: A scene registry helps you track which views correspond to which design phases, keeping client deliverables organized.

Documentation automation
- Auto-generated reports: The tool can generate room schedules, material lists, and quantities automatically from the model.
- Custom templates: Documentation templates reflect your firmâ€™s branding and standards, including cover pages, color palettes, and typography.
- Diagram and annotation automation: Prebuilt diagrams and legends can be added with a single command, reducing manual drafting time.
- Export formats: Reports can be exported as PDF, DOCX, or HTML, enabling easy sharing with clients and teams.

Advanced workflows
Scripting and automation
- Scriptable tasks: The CLI exposes a rich set of commands for common tasks like exporting, labeling, and checking model integrity.
- YAML-based configuration: Projects can store their workflow rules in a YAML file, enabling consistent behavior across builds and teams.
- Batch pipelines: Combine multiple commands into a single pipeline to automate end-to-end processes, from model setup to client-ready exports.

Custom plugins and extensions
- Plugin architecture: Extend Archicad Tools with your own modules. Plugins can register new commands, hooks into the build process, and custom UI elements.
- Safe upgrade path: Plugins run in isolation from core modules, so updates to the core do not automatically break your custom extensions.
- Marketplace concept: A community marketplace lets teams share useful plugins and templates, along with usage metrics and reviews.

Data formats and interoperability
- IFC and BIM data: The toolkit supports common BIM data formats, including IFC, to enable data exchange with other software in your pipeline.
- Rendering outputs: Rendered images and sequences are stored with consistent naming and metadata for easy client review.
- Documentation data: Reports and schedules can be exported into standard document formats for client deliverables and internal reporting.
